# DRUG-RECOMMENDATION-IN-MEDICAL-EMERGENCIES-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Developed an ML-based drug recommendation system for emergencies like floods. It uses vitals (BP, diabetes, temperature) and symptoms as input. A Random Forest Classifier with RFE selects top 15 symptoms to enhance accuracy. It suggests top 3 drugs with dosage and side effects, improving response and patient safety.
